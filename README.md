CameraView by Mijick is a powerful, open-source library that simplifies the camera presentation process, making it super fast and totally customisable, allowing you to focus on the important elements of your project while hiding the technical complexities.
* **Customise your UI completely.** Use a clean and modern UI we designed or change it completely within minutes!
* **Covers the entire process.** Our library both presents the camera controller, asks for permissions, displays an error view if permissions are not granted, and shows the result of the capture in a separate view (if you wish, of course).
* **Improves code quality.** Allows you to focus on the most important things, hiding implementation details inside this powerful library.
* **Designed for SwiftUI.** As we developed the library, we utilized SwiftUI's capabilities to offer you a powerful tool for streamlining your implementation process.

# Getting Started
### ✋ Requirements

| **Platforms** | **Minimum Swift Version** |
|:----------|:----------|
| iOS 14+ | 5.10 |

### ⏳ Installation

#### [Swift Package Manager][spm]
Swift Package Manager is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the Swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding PopupView as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```Swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Mijick/CameraView.git", branch(“main”))
]
```

#### [Cocoapods][cocoapods]   
Cocoapods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects that helps to scale them elegantly.

Installation steps:
- Install CocoaPods 1.10.0 (or later)
- [Generate CocoaPods][generate_cocoapods] for your project
```Swift
    pod init
```
- Add CocoaPods dependency into your `Podfile`   
```Swift
    pod 'MijickCameraView'
```
- Install dependency and generate `.xcworkspace` file
```Swift
    pod install
```
- Use new XCode project file `.xcworkspace`
